# Pick LeetCode
**Boost Your LeetCode Practice with Personalized Problem Selection**

Pick LeetCode is a Chrome extension designed to enhance your LeetCode preparation by helping you choose problems that align with your learning goals and preferences. Target specific difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard), solved status (Solved, Attempted and Unsolved, Not Attempted), premium requirement (Free, Premium), and topics you want to prioritize. You can also choose how many problems to pick at once.üåª

Access the filters through the extension's popup window. After submitting your selections, a new page will automatically open displaying a randomly chosen LeetCode problem based on your criteria. Your preferences are conveniently saved, so you won't need to re-enter them in future sessions. Additionally, the extension allows you to review previously attempted and unsolved problems for deeper learning and improvement.üòâ

Default filters will be enabled if a field is empty:
* Default Difficulties: Easy. Medium, Hard
* Default Status: Attempted (but not solved), Not Attempted
* Default Topics: All the topics
